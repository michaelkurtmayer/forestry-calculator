# forestry-calculator
A script for parsing individuated forest inventories in .csv format and estimating relevant forestry, architectural and environmental factors.

This project is still in progress. Many changes will come in the coming months, but expect it to be fully functional at the end of Summer 2021.

The script parses a csv file of trees with the following information:
  metadata
  species (english)
  height (m)
  dbh (cm)
  
and returns a new csv file of trees with the following information:
  metadata
  species (english)
  height (m)
  dbh (cm)
  basal area (m2)
  biomass of the following components (wood, bark, stem, foliage, branches, crown, total)
  carbon mass of the same biomass components
  
 As the project develops, volume (merchantable and total), equivalent CO2 capture, mean annual increment, stand-level data and more will be added.

 This project began in the context of the Summer Undergraduate Research in Engineering program at McGill University under supervision of Professor Salmaan Craig and Professor Benoit Côté and with the help of multiple students.
